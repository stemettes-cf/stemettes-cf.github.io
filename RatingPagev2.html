       <h4>1. Mojo </h4>
       <p3>Combining shabby New York City dive style chic with great liquor, cocktails, eats and Rock n’ Roll from the last five decades, Manchester's ultimate late night rock bar is the industry bar of choice. Located just across Bridge Street from Spinningfields, it's open until 04:00. So popular, it's not for the claustrophobic and queue shy, however the intimate Rhum Room upstairs offers an alternative place to dance along to classic rock, indie and metal over a great rum collection and cocktails made by the multi-award winning team.
