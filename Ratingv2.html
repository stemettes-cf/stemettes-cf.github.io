      <h4>1. Mojo </h4>
       <p3>Combining shabby New York City dive style chic with great liquor, cocktails, eats and Rock n’ Roll from the last five decades, Manchester's ultimate late night rock bar is the industry bar of choice. Located just across Bridge Street from Spinningfields, it's open until 04:00. So popular, it's not for the claustrophobic and queue shy, however the intimate Rhum Room upstairs offers an alternative place to dance along to classic rock, indie and metal over a great rum collection and cocktails made by the multi-award winning team.</p3> </div>

    <h4>2. Cottonopolis</h4>
     <p3>Opened in October 2015, with a nod to Manchester’s industrial past, this extremely popular cocktail bar truly is a gem within the bustling Northern Quarter.
       Tucked away behind Piccadilly, the venue offers an exclusive experience boasting unique cocktails, an extensive craft ale list including Krusovice Tank beer, a decent wine list with a choice of Sakes, and delicious Japanese-inspired bites served to a soundtrack from some of the best DJs on the Manchester music scene.</p3> </div>

  <h4>3. Epernay</h4>
   <p3>The fantastic Champagne and cocktail bar next to Manchester Central is widely recognised as being one of the best bars in Manchester. Over 32 different Champagnes are available at very reasonable prices, 15 of which are available by the flute, as well as some rare and prestigious wines from all over the region. The signature cocktail menu is created by a team of some of the most established and multi-award winning bartenders in Manchester, whilst the gin list is one of the best in town. Surrounded by the Albert Hall, Bridgewater Hall, Opera House and Palace Theatre, it is very popular for pre-theatre drinks and its sunny balcony overlooking Great Northern Square.</p3> </div>
