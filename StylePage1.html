       <h4> Mystery: The Washhouse </h4>
       <p>The concept here is certainly unique: make a booking, enter a launderette, pick up a phone and be let into one of the coolest speakeasies in the city. But inside you'll find a menu of experimental cocktails that'll take you on quite the tasting journey, with options like a blue cheese cocktail and massive candy-themed sharers.

     <h4>Edgy: Blackdog Ballroom</h4>
      <p> With dwellings in the Northern Quarter and on Oxford Road, Black Dog Ballroom is the ultimate hub for some raucous revelry. Pop down for some pool tournaments, take to their basement dedicated to DJs and dancing, mooch on their rooftop bar or even hire your own private karaoke booth for some no limits singing with mates.

   <h4>Timeless: Mr Cooper's House and Garden's</h4>
    <p>Mr Cooper's House and Garden may not have the biggest collection of gin in Manchester, but of what they are harbouring, the bottles are precise and the mastery behind the cocktails made with them is unique.

      <h4>Vegan: Trof</h4>
      <p>There’s only a few things you need to know about Trof: it has one of the best atmospheres in the bizz; it’s incredibly cool; and it should be your destination whenever you need a hangover breakfast. Even vegans need a cure, and their remedy comes in the form of a beautiful animal-free breakfast which even features a deep fried, breaded avocado.

      <h4>Beer Gardens: The Liquor Store</h4>
      <p> Hidden away just off Deansgate, The Liquor Store is open from 11am until 3am every day of the week. Its outdoor terrace enjoys plenty of sun but also has a covered area should the Manchester weather pay a visit - and makes a great spot for al fresco cocktails or coffee no matter what time of day.
